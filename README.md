When designing software, I focus on keeping things organized and modular. In my 3D scene project, I used separate classes for scene management and camera control, and built custom functions for handling transformations, lighting, and textures. This made the project easier to manage and expand. Working on this helped me improve my skills in creating reusable code and planning ahead. I followed a clear design process: break the project into smaller parts, build each part carefully, and keep everything clean and consistent. These tactics will definitely help me in future projects by making my work easier to scale and debug.

When developing programs, I start small, test often, and build up step-by-step. In the 3D scene, I improved my development strategies by focusing on modular setup and real-time user interaction. Iteration was key — I made lots of small adjustments to camera controls and object placement until everything felt right. My coding style became much more organized and structured by the end of the project. Learning computational graphics and visualizations also gave me skills I can use in future schoolwork and careers, like building interactive 3D environments, making simulations, or working on games.
